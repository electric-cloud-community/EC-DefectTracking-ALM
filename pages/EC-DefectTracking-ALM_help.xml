    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
    What is the tool itself is used for in the development
    process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
    problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
    website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
    outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
    documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
    only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>ALM software is a scalable, unified platform for managing
    and automating the delivery of secure, reliable, and high-quality
    applications. ALM software lets you implement a complete
    quality management infrastructure and establish consistent,
    repeatable processes and best practices for managing
    requirements, tests, and business components.</p>

    <h2>ALM Links</h2>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href=

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to ALM</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
    How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
    functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
    the plugin omit?
    -->

    <p>The EC-DefectTracking-ALM plugin enables you to create,
    update, and link ALM Server defects to an ElectricFlow job. The
    plugin also links to a new report that contains information
    from the ALM server about what was linked, updated, or
    created.</p>

    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Access to the ALM server is required to use this
      plugin.</li>

      <li>This plugin relies on the REST API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against version 11.</p>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
    italics</span>.</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT: In the ElectricFlow UI, go to the Home page, open the Main Menu, and click <b>Admin</b> > <b>Plugins</b> to open the Plugin Manager.</p>

      <h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
      <!-- If the plugin has separate configurations then include this section,
    otherwise omit this whole section. We don't need to have a configuration
    section that just says "There is no configuration for this plugin."
    -->

      <p>
        Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
        across some or all of the plugin's procedures. They 
         reduce repetition of common values, create
        predefined sets of parameters for end users, and 
        securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
        is given a unique name that is entered in designated
        parameters on procedures that use them.<br /><br />
       You create plugin configurations by going to the ElectricFlow "Administration" tab, then to the "Defect
        Tracking" subtab.
      </p>
      <!-- For all parameters, the parameter name should be *exactly* the same as it appears in the
    Parameter Panel, and the first sentence(s) of the description should be
    the same as the tooltip (if there is one). After that, the parameter
    description can go into greater detail about the parameter including
    valid value ranges and examples.

    <h3>Update Defects</h3>

    <p>This enables defects that are associated with a job to be
    automatically updated in the ALM system. Defects are associated
    with a job if they are in a comma-separated list in a job
    property or parameter called "/myJob/defectsToUpdate". Updating
    a defect in the ALM system refers to changing its state to the
    state specified in "/myJob/defectsToUpdate".</p>

    <p>The current status of the defect. By default, the status is
    New. Defect status can be one of the following: Closed, Fixed,
    New, Open, Rejected, or Reopen.</p>

    <h3>Create Defects</h3>

    <p>This enables defect creation based on a test failure in an
    ElectricFlow job. Defects can be created automatically or
    manually. The Create Defects procedure reads previously stored
    properties to create ALM with proper values.</p>		<p>The best
    way to store the properties is to add a postp matcher to the
    step that might fail. Click <a href=
    "../../plugins/EC-DefectTracking-ALM/PostP.txt">here</a> for an example postp matcher.</p>
